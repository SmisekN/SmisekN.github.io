### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    I really enjoyed lab 7 because it had to do with a real world problem that I found interesting. The issue of parking and the fact that each street had unique conditions about which time of day you could park there made it interesting to try and come up with how my code should look. Completing the functions file for this lab also was fairly simple and this lab in particular helped me understand just how important implementing functions can be.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 was a personal favorite of mine because part 2 of the lab had a very satisfying output when it was done correctly. In part 2 of this lab we used a constant variable with a naming format kCounterMax and two for loops inside another for loop in order to create the output pattern. This lab was very short in terms of the amount of code that was put into Visual Studio Code but both parts were challenging despite how little code was required to complete the program. 

* Lab 11

    Unlike the other labs, lab 11 was exceptionally challenging for me because of the concepts that we were implementing in this lab. Lab 11 was the first lab that had me seriously stumped but that is a feeling I need to get used to in computer science so I found this lab very valuable. The use of constructors made this lab very difficult for me because I did not fully understand them before attempting the lab but it was very satisfying once it was completed.
